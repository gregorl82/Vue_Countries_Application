<h2>Brief</h2>
<p>Your task is to build an app that uses the REST Countries API (<a href="https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all">https://restcountries.eu/rest/v2/all</a>) to display information on the countries of the world</p>
<h2>MVP</h2>
<p>Your app should be able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Display the total population of all the countries the API provides.</li>
<li>Allow the user to select a single country and display information about it (at least the country’s name and flag).</li>
<li>Allow users to add their favourite countries to a list that is also displayed in your app.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Extensions</h2>
<ul>
<li>Show a list of the selected country’s neighbouring countries.</li>
<li>Display the total population of these neighbouring countries.</li>
